 <!-- Following are some user stories based on creating To Do Application -->
 <!--1. As a user, I want to add a new task to my To Do list so that I can keep track of my tasks.
 2. As a user, I want to mark a task as complete so that I can see which tasks I have finished.
 3. As a user, I want to delete a task from my To Do list so that I can remove tasks I no longer need to do.
 4. As a user, I want to edit an existing task so that I can update its details.
 5. As a user, I want to filter tasks by their completion status (e.g., all, active, completed) so that I can focus on specific tasks. -->
